WHY WE GIVE
The heart of our heavenly Father is to give. John 3:16 tells us that “God so loved the world that He gave …” This is the spiritual basis for Christian giving, but how does that work itself out? Firstly, we give because we know that we belong to God, we and everything we have are owned by Him and should be at His disposal. Secondly, we give because we have received much. We are blessed by God to be a blessing. Thirdly, we give because we know that money has an important place in building the kingdom of God.
